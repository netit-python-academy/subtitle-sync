# Problem

In this problem you are going to write your first useful program - a program that synchronizes subtitles.
<br>
It is so annoying when you watch a video with subtitles, and they show up on the screen X seconds later/earlier than
they are supposed to.

# Background

The SubRip text file format is a very common caption/subtitle format. SubRip files are named with the extension .srt,
and are therefore also referred to as SRT files. The file contents are simple and easy to read.
<br>
<br>
This program will not accept user input with the input() function as we did up to now. It will accept command line
arguments instead. That would allow us to build a simple command line interface with useful information how to use the
tool.

# What are Command Line Arguments?

Command line arguments are nothing but simply arguments that are specified after the name of the program in the systemâ€™s
command line, and these argument values are passed on to your program during program execution.
<br>
Example -

```code bash
# --version is a cmd argument to the python program
python --version 
```

# Pycharm config

In order to add cmd arguments to Pycharm follow those steps:

# Input

(As cmd arguments)

* a SRT subtitle file
* a float representing the offset in seconds (If the offset is negative, it is guaranteed to be correct - it cannot
  produce negative timings. Example - If a subtitles starts at 00:00:00, and I try to offset it with -3 seconds, it will
  end up being -00:00:03. You won't have to handle such cases).

* -o (Optional) - Output file path, if this cmd argument is present the default output filename should be overwritten

# Output

* A file with the updated subtitle timings

# Usage example

```code sh
# Prints the help menu
python sub_sync --help

# Moves the subtitles in file: 'example.srt' 3.0 seconds forward
python sub_sync example.srt 3.0

# Moves the subtitles in file: 'example.srt' 3.0 seconds backward
python sub_sync example.srt -3.0

# Moves the subtitles in file: 'example.srt' 3.0 seconds backward
# and saves the result to a file in she same dir called test.srt
python sub_sync example.srt -3.0 -o test.srt
```

```code sh
# Creates a file 'output.srt' with the synchronized subtitles
> output.srt file created
```

# Features

* Implement the command line interface
* If no cmd arguments are provided print something like this

```
usage: This is a simple program that can synchronize srt files [-h] file offset
This is a simple program that can synchronize srt files: error: the following arguments are required: file, offset

```

* Print a help message when the `-h` argument is provided

```
usage: This is a simple program that can synchronize srt files [-h] file offset

positional arguments:
  file        Input srt file
  offset      The offset of the subtitles in seconds, it can be positive or negative

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit

```

* You CANNOT use any libraries for parsing the command line arguments
* Implement the main feature - being able to move subtitles forward/backward

# Hints

* To terminate the program you can use sys.exit()
* To get the cmd arguments provided to your program you can use sys.argv
* Read more about them in the official python documentation
* How to read a text file you can find again in the official documentation section - "Input and Output - 7.2"
* Read really carefully the datetime documentation you can find helpful information there
